# **What I use**

Here's a list of hardware and software that I use for my work and at home, along with a brief description of why I use it. I work as a solution architect, most recently for a media company, and have also recently run an IT consultancy concentrating on cloud cost, security and training (including video editing). I just finished up at the media job (mid January 2020) and I start a new job in February 2020 so (a) I have time to write this up and (b) things may change soon (new laptop etc, probably with higher security levels than the BYOD devices I use now).

For the last year I have worked remotely all the time, either at home or in coffee shops, AirBNBs etc. I am based in the UK/London mostly, travelling Europe-wide. I've been in the UK for about a year, previously I was in Australia for 15 years and still own a house there, along with a lot of stuff in storage. I feel like I'm still 'setting up' in Europe.

In my spare time I like to try to be active - run, cycle and go to the gym, and sometimes do triathlons.

I prefer Apple hardware and have a preference for paid software as I feel that gives a better chance that the company (a) will be around long term and will continue to update their apps to add new features and fix bugs, and (b) are less likely to be selling my data.

Links here are not affiliate ones but Amazon links are via [smile.amazon.co.uk](https://smile.amazon.co.uk) which supports your nominated charity, I recommend [Shelter](https://www.shelter.org.uk). I don't bother linking to things you can easily Google for (Apple hardware etc). These are my experiences, yours may differ, these are personal recommendations and not an endorsement by any company I have previously, do now, or will work for.

## **Hardware**

**Laptop**: MacBook Pro 15" 2018 (2.2 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7, Radeon Pro 555X 4 GB, 16 GB 2400 MHz DDR4 RAM). I chose the 15" model for the larger screen space which is handy when working in wide spreadsheets. 16GB because 8GB is not enough for heavy work. 16GB may have been a built to order option, I don't remember. It is quite heavy though, and I am going to be trialling a 13" MacBook Pro soon to see if that's sufficient.

**Charger**: Both the standard 86W Apple charger and a [TOMMOX travel friendly adaptor](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07QW7QYM2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) purchased in January 2020. I'm always on the lookout for new power adaptors (and batteries) and this is the best bang for buck at the moment. I value having USB-C and USB-A charging in one package as it saves me having to use adaptors or docks to charge devices when travelling. It is 60W USB-C though (the 75W they advertise includes all ports added together). When I next upgrade I'll be looking for a high wattage GaN adaptor but they are mostly US only.

**Dock**: [This fairly generic one](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07NPPJWR9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I struggle to justify paying hundreds for a super-nice one. My requirements are gigabit NIC (wifi in my office is poor), HDMI (for playing video on a TV and for presentations), a memory card slot (to set up devices such as the Pi) and some USB-A ports for general charge and sync.

**External monitor**: currently none. I do own a 4K 43" Philips monitor but it's on loan in Australia.

**Power bank**: This [RAVPower](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B06XTMK9H2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) one. 26800mAh is the largest you can carry in carry-on, with USB-C and A output. It can charge my MacBook to about 80% while still using it, and charge a Switch too. I previously bought a similar Anker one from Amazon US but it failed and their warranty was US only.

**Phone**: an iPhone X, 64GB. No case or screen protector, I prefer not to use them. I did buy it with AppleCare+ and I've used both discounted screen repair 'lives'. This is also my only camera and my music/podcast player.

**Watch**: Apple Watch series 4 non-cellular. Used as a watch, to respond to important notifications, kitchen timer, alarm clock, unlock my MacBook, track my workouts and general activity, sleep, etc. I try to 'close my rings' each day, and had a move streak of 203 days that I'm trying to beat. I also join challenges from the Reddit sub /r/AppleWatchFitness. I use a variety of coloured watch bands, both sport ones and Milanese loops for special occasions. (I buy unofficial bands).

**Cables/adaptors**: generally official Apple cables but I also have a USB-A to USB-C/ micro-USB/Lightning cable that was free from a vendor and that I take with me travelling. I also take a generic power plug travel adaptor.

**Laptop case**: [tomtoc laptop case](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B071NK5WQ1/ref=pe_2361882_282382012_TE_item). Fleece lined, small but a perfect fit for the 15" MBP, charger, cables and my glasses. I would prefer it if the front pockets were removable so it could optionally be slimmer - I often have to fit this inside a carry-on (for some of the more frugal EU airlines).

**Overnight bag**: A Samsonite small carry on. This is for overnight travel. I don't see the exact one I have in their range any more and I bought it in a real-world shop so don't have a link. It's much like [this one](https://www.samsonite.co.uk/hexa-packs-laptop-backpack-exp-m-15.6inch-black/116873-1041.html). It's good, but I wish it had an external water bottle carrier.

**eReader**: a basic Kindle. The nearest model to mine I see is [this one](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/amazon-kindle-now-with-a-built-in-front-light/dp/B07FQKFLJT/ref=sr_1_3) but mine was a gift from 3 years ago so it may be slightly different. It's in a generic case sourced from eBay. I go through phases of reading on a Kindle and reading physical books.

**Games console**: A Nintendo Switch, the original version, not the Lite or the newer version with extra battery life. It travels in [this case](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07BS4B2GT/ref=pe_2361882_282382012_TE_item) with about 8 physical cartridges. I own about 50 games with the rest being digital only. I find I play more games when I buy them digital as it saves me finding the right cartridge. I don't play it as much as I would like, lack of time. I expect to travel more in 2020 so should be able to tackle more of my backlog while in airports. I used to play games on an iPhone or iPad but wanted to play more Mario games. (I also own an XBox One X but it's on loan in Australia).

**Authentication**: A Yubikey 4C Nano which lives in one USB-C slot of my MacBook Pro and is used as a Fido key for my 'tier 1' accounts.

**Webcam**: [This one](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01L6L52K4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). A good balance of price and performance. I have people who I contact who only use Skype, others use Zoom, others use(d) Hangouts - this one goes up to 1080p when supported.

**Headphones**: Bose QC35 II. Amazing noise cancellation makes flights much more pleasant and can be used wired if required (e.g. for the Switch, or for super-important calls where you don't want to risk Bluetooth dropout).

**Earbuds**: Beats PowerBeat Pro. Used when running and cycling, they allow some outside noise in for safety. The odd connection issue where one side will drop out, and they have an annoying habit of having one side go flat if you leave them out of the case when not in use. The case is huge too. But I don't feel like they will ever fall out while running or cycling (a problem I found I had with AirPods).

**Presentation clicker**: A [Logitech Spotlight](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/product/spotlight-presentation-remote). A recommendation from [Corey Quinn](https://twitter.com/quinnypig), this is a fantastic device and just being able to use it for a presentation gives me 10% more confidence.

**Others**: 
Sonos (a Beam and a Play:1) for house audio. We have a bigger setup in storage in Australia that we used in a larger house. We love the 'it just works' of the whole house audio, but their apps do suck.

A Samsung Smart TV of some kind - 40-ish inches. Hardwired to the internet router, runs Netflix/iPlayer/etc natively.

A FireTV 4K Stick for other streaming services.

## **Services**

**Phone**: GiffGaff. On the O2 network, costs Â£12/month for 10GB data, coverage is mostly good, the odd drop down to 3G but it's rare. Roaming EU wide (voice and data) is fine and uses your UK allowance.

**Internet**: Virgin Media. 350MB down, 50MB(?) up. I work mostly from home so good fast internet is essential. We've had two outages of a couple of hours each in the last year. Speed has been good, although the wifi router doesn't extend coverage to my office at the other end of our flat (it's a converted victorian house and has thick walls). Virgin also gives free access to other Virgin Media hotspots. I use the default Virgin router for now.

**Other internet**: A credit card gave access to Boingo Hotspots as a member benefit. I closed the card account but the Boingo account still works and is useful sometimes.

**VPN**: Currently [ExpressVPN](https://www.expressvpn.com) as they have a FireTV app which is useful sometimes (along with the normal macOS and iOS apps)

**Streaming**: Spotify, Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Apple TV+, all the non-satellite UK streaming TV channels (we have no TV aerial). I watch too much TV.

**Call/SMS forwarding**: I have an Android phone with my Australian SIM in it under someone's bed in Australia, connected to power and wifi. I use call forwarding to forward voice calls to a Skype number, then use Skype to forward to my UK mobile. I use an Android app to forward SMSs to that number to email. This allows me to use my Australian and UK phone numbers on business cards, and not worry too much about those companies (LinkedIn, ING, PayPal..) and organisations (the Australian government..) that only support SMS 2FA.


## **Software**

Current versions of MacOS, iOS (I don't jailbreak) and watchOS.

For macOS I have my dock on the right hand side - so it doesn't move when I add or remove monitors.

Apps - easier as a table.

|App|macOS|iOS|watchOS|Comments|
|:---:|:-----:|:---:|:-------:|--------|
|Browser|Safari|Safari|None|Fast enough. I use Chrome when I have to but migrated off it as my default browser to reduce my dependency on Google services and apps.
|Email|[Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com)|Spark|Spark|I'm aware of their privacy issues - I don't use the features that cause the main issues, and for me this sits on the right side of the features:privacy divide. I would pay for a better client. I previously used Airmail but found it too buggy.
|Slack/WhatsApp/Telegram client|[Franz](https://meetfranz.com)|Native apps|None|Franz is a memory hog (it's Electron based) but then so is Slack. I tried [Ripcord](https://cancel.fm/ripcord/) for a while but it was early days and feature poor. Looks like it has got better.
|Calendar|[Fantastical2](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)|Fantastical2|Fantastical2|I love the UI and the unified view.|
|Contacts|[Cardhop](https://flexibits.com/cardhop)|Native app|Native app|A new job means contacts are likely to be more important and so I've cleaned them up on the MacBook and am trying CardHop. Seems good so far.|
|Notes|[Evernote](https://evernote.com) and native app|Evernote and native app|None|I'm migrating away from Evernote as I just don't need the functionality it provides and Notes is free. I wish Notes was on the Watch though.|
|Todo|[Todoist](https://todoist.com)|Todoist|Todoist|I like it a lot. Syncs, I can share items with others (we have holiday to do lists at home, etc). Has a web app too. The Watch app is buggy though - syncing with it is very poor so the status of items if often outdated. Watch todos are not something I need though. (As I write this I wonder if it doesn't update properly if it's not set as a complication?)|
|Text Editor|[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)|None|None|All the cool kids use Code, right? I also own Sublime Text but the Code plugin community is awesome.|
|Skype|Native app|Native app|None|Used for some family members who have dumped Facebook|
|Twitter|[Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/)|Tweetbot|None|Love the Tweetbot UI, hate that Twitter's API doesn't expose polls, threads, notifications..|
|CIX|[CIXReader](https://github.com/cixonline/cixreadermac)|[iXolr](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/ixolr-cix-offline-reader/id476884032?ign-mpt=uo%3D4)|None|I use [CIX](https://cix.uk/forums/overview) because I used to work there and know a lot of people there still. It's a fun place, if somewhat cliquey.|
|News/RSS|[News Explorer](https://betamagic.nl/products/newsexplorer.html)|News Explorer|News Explorer|I use RSS feeds to keep up to date with all sorts of things - work news, Apple news, fitness articles, Switch reviews, etc etc. I was a [Reeder](https://www.reederapp.com) user for a long time but felt like a change after v3 and News Explorer works well for me.|
|Photos|Native app|Native app|None|I tried to trial Creative Cloud but the 7 day trial expired before it managed to import my Photos library.|
|Terminal|[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com)|None|None|I'm no terminal wizard but iTerm works for me. I'm not one of those people who tries to SSH into things from their watch in the pub :)|
|Presentations|Keynote|None|None|I don't know why but I prefer Keynote over Powerpoint.|
|Office Docs|Google Docs and MS Office|Google Docs and MS Office|None|My previous job was a heavy Google Docs shop so I got very used to that over the last 10 years. The version of Office for Mac I have is old (the previous version from the current one) and it's not great, Excel in particular has focus issues and modal dialogs all over the place.
|Markdown editor|[MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com)|None|None|I'm writing this in it! I've tried other apps but I come back to this one (although the flickering preview screen is starting to annoy me. Maybe I should try Code again).|
|AV|F-Protect|None|None|I beta test [F-Secure](https://www.f-secure.com/en/home)'s fs protection for Mac because I was a user of the original tool XFENCE, otherwise I probably wouldn't use AV.|
|Password manager|[1Password](https://1password.com)|1Password|1Password|I have a family plan and share logins with my wife.|
|PDF Reader|[PDF Expert](https://pdfexpert.com)|PDF Expert|None|Works well for when you need edits that go beyond the capabilities of Preview.|
|2FA|[Authy](https://1password.com)|Authy|Authy|The problem with yubikeys is losing one. Authy sync my tokens to all my devices. I wish it did it using something other than their cloud service so I use it for 'tier 2' accounts.

### **Miscellaneous macOS tools**:

There are all icons in my menu bar:

![](https://images.paulwakeford.info/arbith-interdeal-preallots-chasteweed.png)

[Bartender 3](https://www.macbartender.com): keeps my menu bar organised.

[PopClip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/): adds a configurable popup menu with useful tasks in in when highlighting text

[DropShare](https://dropshare.app): for sharing screenshots. I use it with my own AWS S3 bucket, domain and CloudFront.

[gfxCardStatus](https://gfx.io): so I know if something is enabling the Radeon GPU (which eats battery)

autoping: a visual indication of my internet connectivity. I can't find a download link for this any more but if you want to try it's 'Connection status monitoring at a glance By Richard West for Memset Ltd. Original concept by Kate Craig-Wood' and I use v1.02.

[PasteBot](https://tapbots.com/pastebot/): a clipboard manager

[iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/): a Swiss army knife of utilities in your menu bar. Clock with multi-city options, CPU load by process, battery status and greedy app list, memory pressure, network throughput, etc etc etc.

	[Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com): backup my entire MacBook to AWS Glacier storage overnight.

[Stay](https://cordlessdog.com/stay/): saves window positions as different screens are connected and disconnected.

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com): Reluctantly using this as a client requires it.

[RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com): I use the free tier to keep an eye on my screen time in more detail than the Screen Time app does.

[Google Drive File Stream](https://www.google.com/drive/download/): I use GSuite (paid) for my consultancy email and docs, this allows me to sync docs to my Google Drive.

[Muzzle](https://muzzleapp.com): disables notifications when certain screen-sharing apps start up. Getting [a bit unmaintained](https://github.com/bdkjones/MuzzleApp/issues) now.

[Turbo Boost Switcher Pro](http://tbswitcher.rugarciap.com): disables Intel CPU turbo boost option while on battery power to [enhance battery life](https://marco.org/2020/01/13/macos-low-power-mode-redux).

[Boom 3D](https://www.globaldelight.com/boom/): testing this, a music equaliser. I'm unsure I play music from my MacBook speakers enough for this to be worth buying.

[Flux](https://justgetflux.com): to reduce screen blueness after sunset. But is the blue light/sleep link a scam? [Who knows](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2020/01/09/blue-light-may-not-cause-insomnia.aspx).

[Be Focused Pro](https://xwavesoft.com/be-focused-pro-for-iphone-ipad-mac-os-x.html): sometimes I need to use the Pomodoro technique to get work done. This app does all the timers for that.

[BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai): enhances the MacBook toolbar greatly. Recently I've found it makes scrolling stutter so I'm using it less.
